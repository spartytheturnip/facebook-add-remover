# facebook-add-remover
A tapermonkey script that as of **2021-10-09** removes sponsored facebook posts from your news feed
on your browser.

## Installation:

1. Install tapermonkey on your browser of choice.
2. Download the file "clean_fb_adds.user.js" and install in the extension or click "raw" on github after opening the file to have it automatically opened in your tapermonkey extension.

Due to the facebook fequently changing their sponsored post implementation this script may break at any time. This script is an approximation and may remove things that aren't adds. This was only tested on my facebook profile / browser combination it may not work on yours.
